# Encryption_AES_CBC

It is a security project using AES CBC cryptography algo.

the project consist of a AES CBC code to encrypt files and folders with a password set by user input.
Using the same password decryption is done.

the implementation is in python version 3.5.0

Ear.py is the train and test file

Use.py is the file used to predict the output after training and testing by loading the trained model

Enjoy the Project
